# New artifacts explored, and progress report so far!
For the past two weeks, I have been working on the following work-items:
1. Learning distributed application development using the 'Actor' model, with [AKKA](https://akka.io).
2. Continuing the work on event-driven database replication for Apache Airavata microservices.
3. Working with Ajinkya and Amruta on the Distributed Task Execution project.
4. Wrote a paper on 'Distributed Task Execution Framework' and submitted to the [PEARC'17](http://www.pearc.org) conference.
